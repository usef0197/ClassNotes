      <h2>Why you should you do cycling?</h2>
      <p>
        Cycling is mainly an aerobic activity, which means that your
        <i>heart, blood vessels and lungs</i> all get a workout. You will
        breathe deeper, perspire and experience increased body temperature,
        which will improve your overall fitness level.

      <h2>Other Benefits of cycling</h2>
      <p>
        Cycling habitually, especially at a high intensity,
        <i>helps lower body fat levels,</i> which promotes healthy weight
        management. Plus, youâ€™ll increase your metabolism and build muscle,
        which allows you to burn more calories, even while at rest.
